## Folder Structure

- **app/**: Contains the main application components, API routes, and pages.
- **components/**: UI components like articles, quizzes, and the sidebar.
- **context/**: Context providers for managing global state (e.g., progress, module data).
- **public/**: Static files like images or icons.
- **styles/**: Global CSS and Tailwind configuration.
- **api/generate/route.ts**: API route that generates course content using OpenAI.

## Usage

The platform allows users to input a topic of interest, and AI generates an interactive course with multiple modules. Each module includes an article, embedded quizzes, and a final quiz. The userâ€™s progress is tracked, and scores from quizzes are displayed.
